    "In this notebook I'm going to show how to build a small and simple recommender system web service from scratch. First of all, we will look at the data that we're going to use, which is about songs. Secondly, we are going to analyse different recommender implementations that might be suitable for the data that we have, we will also compare their metrics to choose our best option. Thirdly, we are going to build a home-made item-based recommender system so that we have an intuition of how everything works at a low-level. Finally, we will see how to start the web service and take into account how to update the structures that we are going to use.\n",

    "First of all we are going to take a look at our data. We will use the [Millong Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) which is a huge dataset of songs with their titles and authors. It also provides a file with the amount of times a user has played a song. We will also use the data present in the [Millon Song Dataset Kaggle's Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msdchallenge/data), which contains some useful data. Explicitely, we are going to use the following files:\n",
    "* *train_triplets.txt*: this file is provided by [*The Echo Nest Taste Profile Subset*](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile). It basically has three fields separated by tabs: user_id, song_id, and play count. It is an explicit interaction between users and items, namely songs. This will pave the way for the recommender systems that we will implement.\n",
    "* *unique_tracks.txt*: list of artist and titles for all tracks in a [text file](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_tracks.txt).\n",
    "* *taste_profile_song_to_tracks.txt*: some of the files refer to the songs by the song_id, but others do so with the track_id. This file maps each song_id to the corresponding track_id.\n",
    "* *kaggle_users*: list of all the users, provided by the kaggle challenge's website.\n",
    "* *kaggle_songs*: list of all the songs, provided by the kaggle challenge's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will fire up all the libraries that we are going to use."

    "In this section we are going to build several recommender systems using different algorithms to compare them and choose our best option. When it comes to building a recommender system for a web service there are several things that we should take into account:\n",
    "* **Accuracy**: of course, we want our recommender system to recommend truly interesting items so that we can keep the user engaged using our system (in this case a music player, such as Spotify). To measure this we are going to use the two more classic metrics: precision and recall.\n",
    "* **Response time**: as it is a web service it should return the recommendations very quickly, say less than a second. This is crucial, since we can build very complex and sophisticated recommender systems with a very high accuracy, but with a very poor performance. Imagine that you are a user using Spotify, you ask the system to make some recommendations for you and it takes more than 3 seconds to get the response. You will probably leave the system and start doing other thing. To succeed in engaging the user, it is pivotal that the recommendations are given in a very short time.\n",
    "* **Updatable**: as previously mentioned, there are several recommender algorithms that can be used, for some of them the update is straightforward, while for others it is not that simple. This is very important to consider, since our recommender should be continuously updated so that the last interactions that a user has are also taken into account for the recommendation.\n",
    "* **Time to build the recommender**: very related to the previous point is the time to create the recommender system. If the system is not updatable very easily, we will have to re-build the system periodically, so it is quite important to consider how much time requires such task.\n",
    "* **Memory usage**: Most of the recommender systems work on memory in order to return a recommendation very quickly. However, if we don't have a great amount of memory available, this turns out to be a very bothering feature that we should also take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined all the variables to look at when we make the comparison, we will split the dataset into a training set, which we will use to create the recommender, and test set, which will be used to get the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we will use [GraphLab Create](turi.com/) which is a very handy library that implements very efficient Machine Learning algorithms. It provides an academic license which I obtained when I fulfilled the [Machine Learning Specialization](www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning). GraphLab provides a set of different implementations for recommender systems, all of which are very efficient in terms of memory and they also provide a method called *recommend* on which it is possible to specify new observation data which is very handy for getting an updated recommendation."

    "Sweet! These are great numbers! It is our best option so far. This is not magic, though, its great accuracy comes from the fact that we are working with implicit data. Users just listen to songs, one or more times, but they don't give an explicit score to each song they listen to, so using the *play_count* as a target to estimate would be a mistake. That's why the previous two options didn't work well. The *jaccard* similarity captures the relationship in implicit data and works very well at normalizing the data. You can see a more detailed explanation [here](https://turi.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.recommender.item_similarity_recommender.ItemSimilarityRecommender.html#graphlab.recommender.item_similarity_recommender.ItemSimilarityRecommender).\n",

    "There are a great bunch of settings that should be configured to get a good result from this model. First of all, we are going to use the Implicit Alternating Least Squares (*ials*) solver which usually works better on implicit data. The *num_factors* indicate the number of factors that are used to represent the latent vectors for users and items, the greater this number the longer it takes to create the model and the greater the accuracy. Finally, the *ials_confidence_scaling_factor* denotes how much importance we are giving to the weights obtained from the *ials* solver."

What takes more time is to get the distance between one song and all the other ones in the dataset. Thus, if we wanted to make it faster and more responsive, we should pre-compute the distances between the items, since they are pretty stable on time, and use those values when making the recommendations.
