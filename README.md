# Recommendation Web Service
This is a step by step script to build a Recommendation System web service from scratch.


In this project I'm going to show you how to build a small and simple recommender system web service from scratch. First of all, we will look at the data that we're going to use, which is about songs. Secondly, we are going to analyse different recommender implementations that might be suitable for the data that we have, we will also compare their metrics to choose our best option. Thirdly, we are going to build a home-made item-based recommender system so that we have an intuition of how everything works at a low-level. Finally, we will see how to start the web service and take into account how to update the structures that we are going to use.
